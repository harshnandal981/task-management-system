## Available Routes

- `/` - Home page
- `/login` - User login
- `/register` - User registration
- `/dashboard` - Main dashboard (protected - requires authentication)

## Authentication Flow

### Registration
1. Navigate to `/register`
2. Fill in name, email, and password
3. Confirm password
4. Submit form
5. On success, redirected to login page

### Login
1. Navigate to `/login`
2. Enter email and password
3. Submit form
4. On success, tokens stored in localStorage
5. Redirected to `/dashboard`

### Protected Routes
- Unauthenticated users trying to access `/dashboard` are redirected to `/login`
- Authentication state is checked on page load
- Access tokens are automatically refreshed when expired

### Logout
- Click "Logout" button on dashboard
- Tokens cleared from localStorage
- Redirected to login page

## Testing the Application

### Prerequisites
Make sure the backend server is running on `http://localhost:3001`

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Test Registration:**
   ```
   - Visit http://localhost:3000/register
   - Register a new user with valid credentials
   - Verify redirect to login page
   - Check for success toast notification
   ```

2. **Test Login:**
   ```
   - Visit http://localhost:3000/login
   - Login with registered credentials
   - Verify redirect to dashboard
   - Check for success toast notification
   - Verify user name is displayed
   ```

3. **Test Protected Routes:**
   ```
   - Without logging in, try to access http://localhost:3000/dashboard
   - Verify redirect to login page
   ```

4. **Test Logout:**
   ```
   - While logged in, click the Logout button
   - Verify redirect to login page
   - Verify cannot access dashboard without logging in again
   ```

5. **Test Token Refresh:**
   ```
   - Login and wait for access token to expire (if backend has short expiry)
   - Make an API call (or navigate pages)
   - Verify token is automatically refreshed without user intervention
   ```

6. **Test Error Handling:**
   ```
   - Try to login with invalid credentials
   - Verify error toast notification
   - Try to register with existing email
   - Verify error toast notification
   ```

## Task Management Features

- **View Tasks**: Browse all tasks with pagination support (10 tasks per page)
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify task title, description, and status
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks with confirmation modal
- **Toggle Status**: Quickly switch task status between PENDING and COMPLETED

### Advanced Features
- **Search**: Find tasks by title (case-insensitive)
- **Filter**: Filter tasks by status (PENDING, COMPLETED, or All)
- **Pagination**: Navigate through multiple pages of tasks
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic task list refresh after operations
